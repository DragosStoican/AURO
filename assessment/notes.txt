All robots should publish known location of clusters
-> /clusters topic sau service sau ceva de genu

/Clusters should be used somehow to create the nav map of the robots

Make robotx/holding_item topic/service/whatever

Think about a service and/or action to create

You will need some topic or something to organize which robot goes for which color


There is a random noise arg, test with that enabled

BEFORE SUBMITTING make sure the original files are not modified!!
Is it ok to change the launch files?? No just use the solution package like he said
Do we have to build it in such a way that it works with any nr of robots?


Collecting waypoints should be global
They should be able to calculate points/second and decide which waypoint to go for
Add a waypoint for passing the grid location where obstacles are so that they make way for eachother


ROBOTController:
STATE1: Navigate to the last waypoint (a collect waypoint)
State2: Pick up item
STATEx: Navigate back to the first waypoint


How do I balance between a sophisticated solution and a performance solution

What makes items not detectable via lidar?
Persistant storage?
Why is the nav2 launch broken and the cameras don't work?
How do I show the camera in gazeebo?
How do I make robotcontroller node wait for all items to spawn before starting?
