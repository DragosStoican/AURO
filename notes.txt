What does the yaw value actually mean? How do I translate that do angles?

How do I visualize the odometry in RVizz or Gazebo?

In the assessment, do we have to design a "safe", like identifying faults and mitigating their effects?
What are the links in gazeebo?

There are a lot of interfaces in the assessment code... Are we expected to create more or is the marking criteria reffering to those?

Why use encoders for odometry instead of world coords?
